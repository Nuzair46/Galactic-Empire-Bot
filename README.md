# Bot-Rewrite
-------------

My try on a general purpose bot.

### Setup
1. Insert Token in `token.txt`.
2. Insert reddit stuff inside `/utils/scraper/reddit.py`.
3. Insert mongodb connector in `/utils/db/mongo.py`.
4. Create mongo db collection as needed. Look into mongo.py for basic structure.
5. Customize help.py inside cogs to your bot invite and server invite.

### Usage

1. With the right buildpacks, this bot can be ran on Heroku.

### Notes

1. I can only help on the codes written right now. I wont be adding any features to this. 
2. This is not a perfect code. This is a really bad one as its my first project of this scale. But it just works. 
3. To know how the bot works in action, You can invite it [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=764164847238643774&permissions=8&scope=bot).
